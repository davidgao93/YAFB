# YAFB-BDO-Project Rev. 1 (10/2/2017) Kamasylvia Update Part 1.

## FOR FISHING ENTHUSIASTS:

Run YAFB_Fishing.au3 to start the script.

### Requirements:
* BDO NA/EU (or EN/DE/FR client language)
* Default BDO Font
* 100% UI Scale (UI Settings ingame)

Works in Fullscreen and Windowed Mode (If the text is a little blurry in windowed just use fullscreen instead)

**BDO must be visible and active (Doesn't work minimized)**

## FOR PROCESSING ENTHUSIASTS:

Run YAFB_Processing.au3 to start the script.

Requirements:
* Storage auto-arrange must be turned **ON**.
* Inventory auto-arrange must be turned **OFF** with the first 4 inventory slots EMPTY or with non-character bound items.
* SAVE settings after any changes otherwise they won't apply!
* All QUESTS from the NPC must be accepted prior!

For custom processing, use round numbers for BATCH and MAX. Basically the bot will do #MAX of #BATCH items. So if MAX was 100, and BATCH was 10, it will do 10 rounds of 10 items.
For example: You have 3651 Birch Lumber, BATCH would be 500, MAX 3500. 

This feature is still under development and might bug.

Any issues please report to the discord at: https://discord.gg/hj6jPrW

## FOR MARKETPLACE SNIPING ENTHUSIASTS:

Run YAFB_MP.au3 to start the script.

Requirements:
* Marketplace must be open on a specific item, image for reference: https://i.gyazo.com/f243cf942bf5031fd53f1fc62abb2c96.png

This feature is also a WIP and might not work as intended, and as such testers as appreciated.

Known issues:

* When there's a item in the bid phase and the next BUY item is much more expensive the bot will keep trying to buy it while waiting for the next phase.
